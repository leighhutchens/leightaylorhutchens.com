# What is product enablement?

Product enablement is about creating an ecosystem where users are continually supported, educated, and empowered to use workforce management software effectively. At its core, it’s about empowering users with the knowledge, skills, and tools necessary to effectively utilize a product to its maximum potential. In the context of Quinyx, it involves a comprehensive understanding of the software's features, functionalities, and best practices to Manage, Optimize, and Engage the frontline workforce efficiently and productively.

While it may seem like a new discipline, Product Enablement has roots that extend back into the broader disciplines of Product Management, Sales Enablement, and Customer Success. The emergence of this particular focus, however, has gained prominence in recent years, especially as organizations strive for greater alignment between product development and customer experience.
